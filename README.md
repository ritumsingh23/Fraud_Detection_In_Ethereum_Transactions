# Fraud_Detection_In_Ethereum_Transactions
This repository contains the files, codes and details about my grad school group project on Fraud Detection in Ethereum Transactions on R-Studio.

Below are the steps to perform the necessary fraud detection:
  1. Download the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/vagifa/ethereum-frauddetection-dataset/download
  2. Use the "R code Group 25.r" code on R-studio to compute the different evaluation matrix for different techniques used.

Details:
In this project we used 4 techniques to determine the fraudulent transaction and using accuracy, sensitivity and specificity to determine the most gerneralizable technique. The boosing technque stood out to be the most generalizable.
